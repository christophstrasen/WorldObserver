- check out https://demiurgequantified.github.io/StarlitLibrary/modules/TaskManager.html#examples
- Investigate what LuaEvents to emit e.g. for diagnostics of the runtime



You asked me earlier: "For record extenders: should we optimize for minimum LoC (shared extender engine) or maximum local readability (keep per-record duplication)?"  and I answered "readability first - I will check it and then give you feedback."

Can we review this now please? SHow me the places in our code that I should review.
Also make a suggestion and give an example or two how the mimimum LoC version could look like and consult me about the consequences and potential tradeoffs.
