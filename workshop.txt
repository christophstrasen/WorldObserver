description=WorldObserver - Shared world observation for Project Zomboid (Build 42)

NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. thx.

WorldObserver is a cooperative world-sensing engine for mid-level Lua mod developers.
Instead of hand-rolling OnTick scan batches and custom caches, you declare interest
in facts (scope, radius, staleness) and subscribe to ready-made observation streams.

Good for mods that need rich, asynchronous information like:
- corpse squares near the player
- kitchens with specific zombie types
- vehicles under attack

This is a developer library, not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
